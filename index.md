## Overview
The [USC Rocket Propulsion Lab (RPL)](http://www.uscrpl.com/) is a team of USC engineering students researching experimental rocket technologies. Each year, members of RPL design, manufacture, and launch rocket vehicles from scratch. The ultimate goal is to reach space, 100km above Earth's sea level through the Karman line.

## Contributions
During my year on the team, I joined the Avionics group led by Aaron Mitchell. I worked on designing a centralized [power distribution system](http://niftyhedgehog.com/usc-rpl-avionics-power/) and prototyped a new [ignition system](http://niftyhedgehog.com/usc-rpl-ignition/).
